# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Creating a study guide from zero has required me to thoroughly understand the basic concepts and break them down into digestible pieces. This process has helped me understand the main knowledge pillars I will need as I move forward in my web development formation. 
Building this project has awakened a new passion that I am very looking forward to develop.
By having been able to create this project with very little skills, I have proved myself capable and it will serve both as a study guide to refer myself and as a reminder for motivation.     
It is comprised of a number of notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
