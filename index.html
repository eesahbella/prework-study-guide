          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>

          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
          <li>Notice the head section, and recall that this is where we store metadata, which contains information about the webpage. This is where we will add the link to our style sheet.</li>
          <li>a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location</li>
          <li>The period preceding (name of the class) designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, (card?), will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>
